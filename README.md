# Machine Learning - Supervised Models
## Objective
The objective of the project is to explore all the supervised models in the field of machine learning.<br>
**Note** : The Deep Learning models are not used.<br>
As we know the supervised ML is further divided into two parts Classifiaction and Regression. In the project I have explored many models in these two areas.

## Datasets
For the classification part I have used **Iris-dataset** ,which contains the data about three types of flowers versicolor,sentosa and virginica. **CO2-emission-dataset** is used for Regression where we need to predict the co2 emission (g/km) using some features.
the datasets are available in **\datasets** folder, But if you want to know more about them visist the following links.<br>

## Classification Models
<ol>
  <li>KNN</li>
  <li>Decision trees</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression and its variants</li>
  <li>Support vector machine</li>
  <li>Random forests</li>
</ol>

## Regression Models
<ol>
  <li>Multiple linear regression</li>
  <li>Lasso and Ridge regressions</li>
  <li>Support Vector Regresssion</li>
  <li>Decision Tree regression</li>
  <li>KNN regression</li>
</ol>

## Procedure
Each model has gone through three steps
1. Creation and Training
2. Evaluation
3. Hyper-parameter tuning
